    <h1>Presentation </h1>
    <p> Let me introduce myself, my name is Bougeant Mathis. Currently, I am pursuing a BUT in Networks and Telecommunications. <br>
        In order to embark on these studies, I obtained my baccalaureate with honors, and as a specialty I had mathematics and physics-chemistry.<br>
        My favorite hobbies include playing sports and spending time with the people I love. In my free time, I can't sit idly by, so when I'm not playing sports, I conduct research to educate myself in areas that interest me.<br>
        What I don't like in life is people who are too focused.<br> 
        I consider myself motivated, ambitious and competitive. I'm going to the end; I hate giving up and feel obligated to finish what I start. I believe that if you want something, you can achieve it through hard work, because hard work always pays off.</br>
        
        I had the opportunity to do a stage in a cybersecurity and telecommunications company called Axians, where I learned a lot about IT. As projects, I worked on documents using LaTeX and created a mini video game.</br>
        
        My life values ​include honesty, respect and, above all, perseverance.
