    <p>After my first year of study, I plan to undertake an apprenticeship to discover the professional world and learn from people with several years of experience in this field. <br>
        Following my three years of study, I plan to work in the field of cybersecurity within a company.<br>
          What appeals to me about this profession is its diversity. What I mean by that is that you will never do the same thing repeatedly because there are always different challenges. <br>
          For example, we might be involved in network installations in buildings, scanning computers for security vulnerabilities, carrying out IT installations, etc.</br>
        
          In addition to my job, I plan to invest in real estate to generate additional income.</p>
